# Chinese Remainder Theorem

We are given two arrays num[0..k-1] and rem[0..k-1]. In num[0..k-1], every pair is coprime (gcd for every pair is 1). We need to find minimum positive number x such that: 

```
     x % num[0]    =  rem[0], 
     x % num[1]    =  rem[1], 
     .......................
     x % num[k-1]  =  rem[k-1] 
```
